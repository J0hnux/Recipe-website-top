## Recipe Page
Create a basic recipe page to showcase basic use of HTML & CSS.    

## Thoughts
This was the very first assignment that I received from The Odin Project, which requires the use of all concepts that were already tackled so far in the curriculum which is how to write the structure of an html file or the html boiler plate, basic tags like the header tags from h1 to h6, the use of the <a> or the anchor tag, and lastly how to use many more tags and elements that were used in making this simple recipe page.
